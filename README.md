# Part libraries for CadSoft EAGLE
Some of Eagle parts I have create and/or found on the internet.

## Submodules
The included submodules reference some of the libraries I use (often).

Note that these libraries most likely have a different license than the ones I have created.

## Getting all libraries in one directory
By running `collect.sh` all `*.lbr` files are copied to the `collection` folder.
