# Part libraries for CadSoft EAGLE
Some of Eagle parts I have create and/or found on the internet.

## Submodules
The included submodules reference some of the libraries I use sometimes.

Note that these libraries most likely have a different license than the ones I
have created.

## Getting all libraries in one directory
By running `collect.sh` (Linux) or `collect.bat` (Windows) all `*.lbr` files are
copied to the `collection` folder. That way you only have to add the
`collection` folder to your EAGLE configuration.
